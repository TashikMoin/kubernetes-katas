Request is the amount that the scheduler looks at when scheduling the pod. It is the minimum threshold of any 
resource (CPU, memory) that pod needs to get scheduled on any cluster node. If the pod does not find
the threshold specified inside the resource on any Kubernetes node, then we may see an un-schedulable error or 
insufficient CPU, or memory error in events.

limit is the amount of resources a pod can consume after getting scheduled. By default, if you don't set a limit, its value is set to infinity (0)
which means the pod has no limit and can consume any amount of resources (CPU, memory) once scheduled (after finding the appropriate node based on the 
defined resource request threshold).
