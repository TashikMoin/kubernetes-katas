        # during the 30s sleep, the liveness check will satisfy and the "cat /tmp/healthy"
        # command will return "0" which means success! if values other than 0 is returned
        # by the liveness check command, then it is considered as unhealthy and the liveness
        # check is failed and a new pod/container is created again. In this case, after 30 seconds
        # sleep, the liveness check will start failing because the file is removed after first sleep
        # of 30 seconds Kubernetes only monitors container health not the application's health
        # running inside it. Using liveness probe check, we can monitor the application health
        # and create new pod/container incase of unhealthy applications (failed liveness checks).

        # check can be applied to that application running in a container.
        # 5 seconds are enough to create a /tmp/healthy file after pod creation
        periodSeconds: 5
        # periodical time after which the liveness check is applied again and again.
        timeoutSeconds: 15
        # response waiting time, In this case, if a response for a liveness check does not return
        # any response till 15s, it will then create a new pod/container.
