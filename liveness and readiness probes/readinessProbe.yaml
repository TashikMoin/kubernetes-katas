        # ready pods are those pods that are available for a service. A pod with containers
        # reporting that they are not ready does not receive traffic through Kubernetes Services.
        # Note: Readiness probes runs on the container during its whole lifecycle.

        # Here, after the pod is created, the container sleeps for 30 seconds and the readiness
        # check "cat /tmp/healthy" fails for the first 25 seconds (-5 of initial delay) because
        # of the first sleep. After the first 30s sleep, the file is created and now the readiness
        # check returns 0 which means success and now the pod's container are in ready state and
        # hence the pod is now available for kubernetes services.

        # not sent till 15s, it will then create a new pod/container.
