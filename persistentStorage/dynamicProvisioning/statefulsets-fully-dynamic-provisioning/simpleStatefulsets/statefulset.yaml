        # using built-in managed-premium storage class for fully azure disk dynamic provisioning

        # NOTE: we cannot use shared storage and shared storage's storage classes with statefulsets
        # because the volume will not be shared between the pod's pvc and pvs instead the pv and pvc
        # will slice the underlying storage and make isolated pv and pvc for each pod running in a
        # statefulset.

        # WARNING: DO NOT USE File storage like AzurefileShare etc / NFS with statefulset!

        # we can also make our custom storage classes as well. In fully dynamic provisioning we only
        # define the storage provisioning storage class and then define pods and associate pods
        # with that storage class for fully dynamic provisioning of persistent storage.

        # each pod will have its own pv,pvc in case of statefulsets which is not shared with other pods.

        # each pod's pv,pvc running under a statefulset has its unique id starting from 0 -> n.

        # creation of pods in a statefulset starts from 0 -> n order and not random. The 0th pod and pv,pvc
        # are created first and then 1st then 2nd and so on.. The deletion is done in reverse order means
        # n -> 0th pod and not random deletion.

        # If a shared storage is provisioned for statefulset like nfs or fileshare storage, then still
        # the statefulset does not share the storage because they have their own isolated pv,pvc and the
        # pv,pvc will allocating persistent storage for the pods by slicing the underlying storage.
